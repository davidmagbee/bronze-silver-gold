# Bronze, Silver, and Gold

When you've come up with an idea, I'd like you to please write down "bronze", "silver", and "gold" versions of it.

**Gold** will almost always be the idea as it first occurs to you: what the final product would look like with all the polish and features you'd like it to have.

**Bronze** is the idea stripped down to the MVP -- the bare minimum your product needs to be identifiable.

**Silver** is between the two: what you'd feel comfortable showing to a client as a "work in progress", were they to have commissioned this.

For a Tic Tac Toe game, the breakdown might look like this:

- **Bronze**: An HTML page with a table of 9 cells. Just enough Javascript to show you who the current player is and change the background color of a cell when you click on it. Just enough CSS to make the cells visible.

- **Silver**: Enough CSS to make it actually look like a game, and enough Javascript for a "reset" button.

- **Gold**: CSS transitions or animations, and cleanly-written Javascript that tells you when the game is over and who won.

Whenever you have a moment of "Ooh, I should add this" add it to your **gold** list. If that idea didn't occur to you at the start, it's probably not necessary for your MVP.
